  The Py3dsMax Tutorial
#################################

What is Py3dsMax?
=================

Py3dsMax is a Max plugin that embeds python within Max.  This allows python
scripts to run natively within the Max environment.  It allows maxscript
commands to be called from python; and conversely, python commands to be 
called from maxscript.  


Why python?
=================

Python is arguably the most popular scripting language, especially amongst 3D
applications.  Many 3D apps already support python natively.  There is a large
community of python develepers, and in addition to a large standard library, 
there is an even larger collection of 3rd party python libraries for nearly
every purpose.  Py3dsMax allows Max developers to leverage that vast python
codebase.


What if I can't find what I'm looking for?
==========================================

Send an email to codefoo@blur.com with any questions or reports of areas of
blurdev that need better documentation.  Or better yet, you could try creating
the documentation yourself.  We always need more help writing and maintaining
documentation.
