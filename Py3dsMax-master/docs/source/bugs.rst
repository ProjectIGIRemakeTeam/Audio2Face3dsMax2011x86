Reporting Bugs
**************

If you think you've found a bug, try asking about it on codefoo@blur.com.
It's possible that the bug has been fixed in a dev build, or that it's a known
issue, or perhaps it's even expected bahavior.

You can also create a 
`new bug <http://redmine.blur.com/projects/bucket/issues/new>`_ 
report in redmine.
